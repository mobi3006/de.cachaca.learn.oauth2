# OAuth 2 in Action - Getting Started

This repository simplifies the deployment of the examples in the excellent book [OAuth 2 in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action) by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso. It uses the examples provided at [GitHub](https://github.com/oauthinaction) - this code is integrated into this repository (folder *oauth-in-action-code*).
